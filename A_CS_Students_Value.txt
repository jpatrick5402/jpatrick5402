One of the hardest facts about computer science is that there is actually very little substantially required material in the program. Our job is not recite vocabulary or diagnose patients or anything regarding what information is already out there. Our job is to make a process more efficient. This is why most of the computer scientists that you see in the world have a very distinct personality behind them.

When I say that this a hard fact, I'm not referring to the complexity of the statement I just presented, I'm referring to the difficulty which then follows for all computer science students. Once a computer scientists gets their degree, the individual may be drawn to programming because it seems to be the most practical of computer science applications, however programming does not necessarily use any major skill that is taught through your traditional style of course at any level. What computer science truly has to offer the world is not text in a file that performs actions, it's the style of thinking that computer scientists must do for every detail that they implement into their projects.

Though studying computer science doesn't build an individual's mind in a different way, it does correct the already embedded method of thinking. What this can lead to in the workforce is a new phenomenon which I prefer to describe as "standardized creativity." Though there isn't an exact method of solving this issue, I'm positive that as the education that is backed behind computer science continues to grow and the knowledge begins to become more developed, there will arise a book or learning material that is a definite way to think indefinitely, but the key to this book is that it will never be finished as human though will always grow and it will always be changing base on what the world deems most efficient.
