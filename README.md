Hi, I’m @jpatrick5402, I am a student in Computer Science, and I code for fun. 
I’m interested in Cyber Security, Robotics, and anything related to Computers. 
I’m currently learning Networking, C/C++, and Unix. 
I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that require critical thinking. 
How to reach me jpatrick5402@gmail.com.
